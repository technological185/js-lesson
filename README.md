##Day 1: Introduction to JavaScript
### What is JavaScript?
JavaScript is a versatile programming language primarily used for creating interactive effects within web browsers. It allows developers to implement complex features on web pages, such as dynamic content updates, multimedia handling, and user interface enhancements.
### Setting Up Your Environment
To start coding in JavaScript, you'll need a text editor and a web browser. Popular text editors include Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, and Atom. Most modern web browsers, like Google Chrome, Firefox, and Edge, come with built-in developer tools that allow you to write and test JavaScript code directly in the browser.
### Writing Your First JavaScript Code
You can write JavaScript code directly in an HTML file using the `<script>` tag. Here's a simple example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My First JavaScript</title>      
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <script>
        console.log("Hello, World!");
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```
In this example, the JavaScript code inside the `<script>` tag will print "Hello, World!" to the browser's console. You can view the console by opening the developer tools in your browser (usually by pressing F12 or right-clicking and selecting "Inspect" or "Inspect Element").
